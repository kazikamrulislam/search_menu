                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p>
                        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
                        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
                        HTML describes the structure of a Web page
                        HTML consists of a series of elements
                        HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
                        HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", 
                        "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
                    </p>

                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p>
                        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
                        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
                    </p>

                    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:<br>
                        
                        1. HTML to define the content of web pages<br>

                        2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages<br>

                        3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages<br>

                        Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used. 
                        Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is 
                        the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, 
                        also use JavaScript as their programming language.

                        What is PHP?<br>
                        PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"<br>
                        PHP is a widely-used, open source scripting language<br>
                        PHP scripts are executed on the server<br>
                        PHP is free to download and use<br>
                        What is a PHP File?<br>
                        PHP files can contain text, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP code<br>
                        PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is returned to the browser as plain HTML<br>
                        PHP files have extension ".php"<br>
                        What Can PHP Do?<br>
                        PHP can generate dynamic page content<br>

                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>
                        What is Python?<br>
                        Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.<br>
                        
                        It is used for:<br>
                        
                        web development (server-side),<br>
                        software development,<br>
                        mathematics,<br>
                        system scripting.<br>
                        What can Python do?<br>
                        Python can be used on a server to create web applications.<br>
                        Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.<br>
                        Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.<br>
                        Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.<br>
                        Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.<br>
                        Why Python?<br>
                        Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).<br>
                        Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.<br>
                        Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with 
                        fewer lines than some other programming languages.<br>
                        Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can 
                        be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping 
                        can be very quick.<br>
                        Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated 
                        way or a functional way.

                    <p>
                        What You Should Already Know<br>
                        Before you start studying jQuery, you should have a basic knowledge of:<br>
                        
                        HTML<br>
                        CSS<br>
                        JavaScript<br>
                        If you want to study these subjects first, find the tutorials on our Home page.<br>
                        What is jQuery?<br>
                        jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.<br>
                        The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.<br>
                        jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to 
                        accomplish, <br>
                        and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.<br>
                        jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like 
                        AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.<br>
                        The jQuery library contains the following features:<br>
                        HTML/DOM manipulation<br>
                        CSS manipulation<br>
                        HTML event methods<br>
                        Effects and animations<br>
                        AJAX<br>
                        Utilities

                    <p>
                        SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.<br>

                        What is SQL?<br>
                        SQL stands for Structured Query Language<br>
                        SQL lets you access and manipulate databases<br>
                        SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986,<br> 
                        and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987<br>
                        What Can SQL do?<br>
                        SQL can execute queries against a database<br>
                        SQL can retrieve data from a database<br>
                        SQL can insert records in a database<br>
                        SQL can update records in a database<br>
                        SQL can delete records from a database<br>
                        SQL can create new databases<br>
                        SQL can create new tables in a database<br>

                        What is Node.js?
                        Node.js is an open source server environment <br>
                        Node.js is free<br>
                        Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)<br>
                        Node.js uses JavaScript on the server<br>
                        A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the <br>
                        server and return the content to the client.<br>
                        
                        Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:<br>
                        
                        Sends the task to the computer's file system.<br>
                        Waits while the file system opens and reads the file.<br>
                        Returns the content to the client.<br>
                        Ready to handle the next request.<br>
                        Here is how Node.js handles a file request:<br>
                        
                        Sends the task to the computer's file system.<br>
                        Ready to handle the next request.<br>
                        When the file system has opened and read the file, the server 
                        returns the content to the client.<br>
                        Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.<br>
                        
                        Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming,<br> 
                        which is very memory efficient.
